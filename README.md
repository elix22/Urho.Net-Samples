Samples for the Urho.Net cross platform C# game development framework 

https://github.com/Urho-Net/Urho.Net

Make sure you are using the latest Urho.Net framework package.\
If you update the Urho.Net framework , please make a clean build on your project ,\
Either using Visual Studio Code or Visual Studio (in VS-Code it's Shift+Ctrl+P , Run Task ,  clean)

Each folder is a fully self contained Visual Studio code project , containing all the scripts and tools to allow pleasent and fluent development.
  The downside of it is that this is a hugh repo.

You can download a single folder by using SVN , for example downloading only the MultipleViewports sample project :

`svn co https://github.com/elix22/Urho.Net-Samples/trunk/MultipleViewports  MultipleViewports`

Every folder can be downloaded in the same way by using svn :

`svn co https://github.com/elix22/Urho.Net-Samples/trunk/FOLDER-NAME  FOLDER-NAME`
